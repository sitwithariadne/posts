_This is from a dark time._

  ---
  
I am alone.  

In my house,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am alone.  
  

On the street,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am alone.  
  

At my school  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am alone.  
  

In my class,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am alone.  
  

In this world,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am alone.  

In my ways of thinking,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my uniqueness separates me.

In my beliefs,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my morals bind me.

In my heart,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my desperation chokes me.  
  
All my assets are liabilities.  
  
I pray the weekend never comes,  
the empty time, and abyss,  
its soulless despair.  
  
I leave my house to interact,  
the interactions are meaningless.  
  
No new friends acquired,  
no one would know me.  
  
I have nothing to offer.  
  
Who could guess how alone I feel,  
I cover my loneliness in confidence,  
pretending weekends don't scare me.  
  
And no one befriends a loner.
